# DAT Inspector

A utility for reviewing PeopleSoft Data Mover DAT file contents.

DISCLAIMER: I did not write this utility. It was written by a PeopleSoft employee (Chris Speer) in 1998 and I'm just putting it here for prosperity/historical reasons since it's hard to find now. It still seems to work with .DAT files produced by the PeopleTools 8.5x releases of Data Mover, but your mileage my vary. Use at your own risk. For a more modern DAT file utility, check out [DMS Viewer](https://github.com/tslater2006/DMS-Viewer).
